* Given matrix A and vector $\vec x$;
* If $A\vec x=0$, then $\vec x$ is in null space of A. aka N(A)
* If $A\vec x=c\vec x$, where c is  a scalar, then \vec x is a eigenvector and c is the eigenvalue
* The number of eigenvectors and eigenvalues depend on _____
* Consider a square matrix A of size mxm. It has m eigenvalues.
* Sum of eigenvalues = trace(A)= sum of diagonal elements
* Product of eigenvalues = det(A)

* If A is square and A=A(t) (transpose), then its called symmetric matrix
  - aij=aji for all i and j

* If A is symmetric. And if all eigenvalues have same sign (all positive or all negative), then those are special symmetric matrices.
  * if all eigenvalues>=0; A is positive semidefinite
  * if all eigenvalues>0; A is positive definite
  * if all eigenvalues<=0; A is negative semidefinite
  * if all eigenvalues<0; A is negative definite


* Assume A is sqaure matrix, (may not be symmetric)
  * Trace - tr(A)- sum of diagonal elements = sum of eignvalues
  * Determinant of matrix= product of eigenvalues
    * Determinant=product of pivots
      * pivots==eigenvalues?
  * log (Det(A))= sum of eigenvalues (comes up helpful in max likelihood estimate, involving gaussian PDF)

* Properties involving multiple matrices
  * Trace of sum of matrices is sum of traces
  * Det of (product of matrices)= Product of determinants
  * $(A*B)^{-1}=B^{-1} * A^{-1}$
  * $(A*B)^{T}=B^{T} * A^{T}$
  * $(A^{-1})^{T}=(A^{T})^{-1}$

* Derivative of matrix.

Ax, where A is matrix, x is vector. derivative (Ax) wrt x-  Jacobian matrix
